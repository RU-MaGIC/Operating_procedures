# Molecular and Genomics Informatics Core Onboarding

## Mission Statement
The mission of the Molecular and Genomics Informatics Core is to support cutting edge researchers by providing expertise in high-throughput computational analyses. This is to be provided by utilizing up-to-date pipelines for expediting standard workflows, and implementing custom bioinformatics analyses to accomodate the myriad of solutions for academic research. MaGIC will also emphasizes training opportunities by providing remote bioinformatics learning tools, project support and assistance on request, and regular courses.

## Code of Conduct
All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with this code of conduct. We will enforce this code. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody. The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. However, do note that we work on biological matters so work-related discussions of e.g. animal reproduction are appropriate. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Alex Lemenze immediately. If Alex is the cause of your concern, Deborah Lazzarino (lazzarda@rutgers.edu) is a good informal point of contact; she is Alex's direct supervisor, or submit a formal complaint directly to the Office of Employment Equity through the [Rutgers OneSource Service Center](https://discover-uhr.rutgers.edu/onesource/home). For further information on the Rutgers NJMS official policy see [here](https://policies.rutgers.edu/60112-currentpdf#:~:text=Rutgers%20University%20is%20committed%20to,(%E2%80%9Cprotected%20classes%E2%80%9D).)
 
We expect members to follow these guidelines in all in person, phone, online communication, lab-related events, university events, conferences, etc.

## Access and communication
### Email:
Email is to be the primary mode of communication for any documented discussions. Emails sent after standard working hours are not expected to be read until the next working day, including weekends. If you wish to answer emails in those times you are free to- but it is not expected. 

All emails are expected to be professional. When in doubt- open with a nice sentence, get to business, and end with a pleasant note. Ex:

```
Hi Dr. Doe, 

Thanks for reaching out with your questions, I would be happy to help with those! Please see each response below in blue. If you have any additional questions, please dont hesitate to reach out!

Best, 
Alex

### Microsoft Teams:
Rapid communication will be facilitated via Teams. During normal work hours you are expected to be reasonably accessible. All Rutgers employees and students will have free access to Teams.

### Github
Lab members are expected to have a personal Github account. Once a part of the lab, please request with Alex to be added to the MaGIC Github organization. As a primarily dry lab, most collaboration is expected to be facilitated through Github, and all projects (successes and failures) are to be openly available on Github. 

## Expectations
In general, the lab is to be a comfortable but productive environment. Everyone works differently, so flexibility is generally accepted as long as assignments are being completed within deadlines. All members are expected to be accesible during core working hours (10-3 EST) for questions or meetings, but actual working hours may be at discretion of the project and personal preference. There is no expectation for working beyond normal working hours (9-5 EST, M-F) unless working in a flexible capacity. Occasional requests may be made for odd-hour work for specific projects or large volumes. 

All lab members are actively encouraged to seek assistance from each other or outside resources to achieve their goals. Any project or task will have an upfront discussion on timeframe and is expected to be completed within the designated time. Any delays should be proactively discussed with investigators or Alex. 

For the courtesy of others, please use headphones when listening to music (at a normal volume), and take conference calls/phone calls in an isolated room. Work from home is permitted, but members working from home are still expected to be available for meetings or questions. Cute animals and children in the background are welcome and should never be a point of concern. For all virtual meetings or discussions, you are expected to be on mute unless you are talking, especially if you have potential noise makers. 

### Student Expectations
Students are expected to focus on specified research projects or collaborator (co-PI) projects, as well as required coursework. All students should regularly share their research in lab meetings or journal clubs.

### Staff Expectations
Staff members are expected to focus on Core operations. This includes pipeline development assignments, collaborator project assignments, and one-off coding assignments as delegated by senior members. A weekly report should be turned in by EOW with brief details on progress made during the week as well as goals for the upcoming week. 

### Expectations for Alex
Alex is expected to foster an environment for successes in the lab. This includes regular meetings with lab members, being a point of contact for troubleshooting, assisting to devise a project, offer career guidance, and find funding for the lab. 

### Lab meetings
All lab members are expected to participate in a weekly lab meeting (TBD time). Each meeting will have an in-person and virtual location to facilitate members in various locations. All students involved in active research projects will be expected to present on a quarterly basis, and a regular circulation of presenting novel papers will be established. 

#### Hackathons
Lab members are encouraged to participate in general hackathons, and the lab will host semi-regular hackathons for members to focus on specific projects. Senior lab members will be assigned to lead hackathons of various themes, and all members are expected to participate. All hackathons will have food provided by Alex, and please contact Alex if you have a particular idea you wish to see hackathon-ed. 

## Ethics
Per the [Rutgers Research Misconduct Policy](https://orra.rutgers.edu/rimisconduct)
Rutgers faculty, administration, staff, students and volunteers have an important responsibility to maintain high ethical standards in research, research training programs, and activities related to such research or training.  These standards include validity, accuracy and honesty in proposing and performing research, in collecting, analyzing and reporting research results, and in reviewing the research of others.  Failure to observe these principles that results in research misconduct damages the general public trust, the entire academic and scientific community, and the University’s image.  In addition, University personnel who commit research misconduct breach their obligations to the University

### Data Sharing and reproducibility
Open source data is a priority for MaGIC. As a Core facility and a research lab, collaboration is a vital key for continuation of science. All code will be version-controlled via Github, and each project shall have documentation reviewing the code and software versions used. All data is expected to be shared upon publication, with the appropriate repository receiving applicable raw data (such as FASTQS to GEO). Unpublished scientific material should be retained between lab members and collaborators only until publication. 

### Notebooks
All computation is expected to provide code via Github, with lab members encouraged to use digital notebooks (such as [Juptyer](https://jupyter.org/) or [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)). Any wetlab experiments require a traditional lab notebook. 

## Celebrations
### Rewards
We are a big believer in celebrating the good stuff in life. For every lab member upon a major life achievement (ie Wedding, graduating etc) or first author publication, you have the choice of:
- Ice cream party
- Pizza party
- Open bar tab
for the lab in your honor. If you have any issues with these, please bring it to Alex to discuss a fitting alternative- we will celebrate somehow, even if its as simple as you getting an extra day off. 

### Failures
We also need to "celebrate" failures- they often are how we learn the most. For every publication rejection, grant rejection, or major lab snafoo we will plant a tree. Then no matter how bad the issue is, life will come of it and improve our planet.
